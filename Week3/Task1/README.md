# Task 1

To write a **python** code for reading the **contents** of a **URL**. In this task we will read the contents of **Linked In** website.Then we will move the **result** (response) which was in a `.text` format to `.html` format.

HTTP is a **set** of **protocols** designed to enable communication between **clients** and **servers**. It works as a **request-response** protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server. So, to request a response from the server, there are mainly two methods:

 1. **GET** : to **request** data **from** the server.
 2. **POST** : to **submit** data to be processed **to** the server.

## Installing Requests

 - In Ubuntu OS:
    `pip3 install requests`
 - In Windows OS:
 ` python -m pip install requests`
or
`py -m pip install requests`
The previous commands would be entered trough the **terminal** "Linux" or the **command** **line** "Windows" and if **PyCharm** IDE were used , you should install the required libraries by going to:
**File -> Settings-> Project Interpreter** 
  Then choose the `+` sign **above** in the **right** and write the name of the required libraries you will be using in your application.
